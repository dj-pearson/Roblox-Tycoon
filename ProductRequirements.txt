- ⬜ Verify TycoonSystem ownership and management is complete
- ⬜ Verify SpecializationSystem covers all specialization types
- ⬜ Verify SeasonalSystem implements all seasonal event types
- ⬜ Verify MilestoneSystem implements all progression metrics
- ⬜ Verify RevenueSystem implements all revenue sources
- ⬜ Verify MemberSatisfactionSystem implementation
- ⬜ Verify integration between systems via CoreRegistry

### Verification Process
For each item on the list:

1. Compare code functionality between old and new implementations
2. Test systems with the new implementation to ensure all features are preserved
3. Document any missing functionality that needs to be migrated
4. Move verified redundant files to the Unused directory
5. Update this list with results (✅ for completed verification, ❌ for items requiring additional work)

### Migration Priority
Focus on verifying and potentially removing these systems first:
1. Core systems (BuyTile, EventSystem, SystemManager)
2. UI components (FrontDeskPrompt, RevenueDisplay)
3. Utility scripts (Cleanup, ErrorSuppressor, AdminCommands)
4. Basketball system scripts
5. Backup comparisons

### Additional Notes
- Before removing any file, ensure it is backed up in the Unused or Backups directory
- Document any functionality that hasnt been migrated but should be preserved
- Consider creating unit tests for crucial systems during verification
- Use the TestingFramework.server.luau to verify system functionality
- Unused folder are a collection of old scripts that will not move to the new architecture but may be good to reference on functionality. 
- Folder script naming considerations: client scripts should end with .client.luau, server scripts should end with .server.luau, and shared scripts should end with .luau. This will help identify the purpose of each script at a glance and tell Roblox the specific type of script that they are.

### New Systems to Implement
- ✅ Memory Store for Temporary Data
- ✅ ConfigManager for centralized configuration
- ✅ State Management Framework
- ✅ Enhanced Event System for efficient communication

1. Complete verification of all potentially redundant files
2. Finalize RevenueClient and SaunaClient in src/client/ClientCore
3. Implement Memory Store for Temporary Data
