- ✅ Verify RevenueSystem implements all revenue sources
- ✅ Verify MemberSatisfactionSystem implementation
- ✅ Verify integration between systems via CoreRegistry

### Verification Process
For each item on the list:

1. Compare code functionality between old and new implementations
2. Test systems with the new implementation to ensure all features are preserved
3. Document any missing functionality that needs to be migrated
4. Move verified redundant files to the Unused directory
5. Update this list with results (✅ for completed verification, ❌ for items requiring additional work)

### Migration Priority
Focus on verifying and potentially removing these systems first:
1. Core systems (BuyTile, EventSystem, SystemManager)
2. UI components (FrontDeskPrompt, RevenueDisplay)
3. Utility scripts (Cleanup, ErrorSuppressor, AdminCommands)
4. Basketball system scripts
5. Backup comparisons

### Additional Notes
- Before removing any file, ensure it is backed up in the Unused or Backups directory
- Document any functionality that hasnt been migrated but should be preserved
- Consider creating unit tests for crucial systems during verification
- Use the TestingFramework.server.luau to verify system functionality
- Unused folder are a collection of old scripts that will not move to the new architecture but may be good to reference on functionality. 
- Folder script naming considerations: client scripts should end with .client.luau, server scripts should end with .server.luau, and shared scripts should end with .luau. This will help identify the purpose of each script at a glance and tell Roblox the specific type of script that they are.

### New Systems to Implement

- ✅ ConfigManager for centralized configuration
- ✅ State Management Framework
- ✅ Enhanced Event System for efficient communication

# UI Component Implementation Update (April 18, 2025)

An extensive review of UI components in the codebase has been completed. The following findings and changes have been documented:

## UI Component Architecture

The UI architecture follows a consistent pattern across all implemented components:
- Base components inherit from UIComponent.luau with standardized functionality
- Each UI module is self-contained with clear responsibilities
- Components use EventBridge for communication with server systems
- All components follow the UIStyle guidelines for visual consistency

## UI Modules Implementation Status

### Successfully Migrated UI Modules
- ✅ RevenueDisplay: Fully migrated and enhanced with improved visual feedback
- ✅ SatisfactionDisplay: Complete with member satisfaction metrics visualization
- ✅ CompetitionUI: Successfully migrated with proper event handling
- ✅ SeasonalEventsUI: Implemented with interactive seasonal event participation
- ✅ SpecializationsUI: Completed with specialization selection interface
- ✅ JobsUI: Successfully migrated with improved staff management UI
- ✅ SaunaTemperatureUI: Fully implemented with temperature visualization
- ✅ RebirthUI: Complete with enhanced animations and progression tracking
- ✅ UIComponent: Base class implementation complete with standardized functionality
- ✅ UIStyle: Style guide implementation with consistent theme application

### UI Modules Marked for Priority Implementation (May 2025)
- ⬜ StaffManagementUI: Needs implementation of staff profiles, training interface
- ⬜ SettingsMenu: Requires implementation of game configuration options
- ⬜ MilestonesMenu: Needs visual milestone tracking implementation
- ⬜ AchievementsMenu: Requires achievement category display implementation
- ⬜ AchievementNotification: Needs animation and notification queue system

### Additional UI Consistency Findings
1. All implemented UI modules use consistent styling patterns
2. Event handling follows standardized approach through EventBridge
3. Animation sequences use common tween configurations
4. UI responsiveness is maintained across different screen sizes
5. Error handling for UI components is properly implemented

## Client-Server Communication Patterns

A standard pattern for client-server communication has been established:
1. Client modules use dedicated RemoteEvent connections
2. Server responds with standardized success/failure responses
3. Data validation occurs on both client and server sides
4. Rate limiting is implemented to prevent exploitation
5. Error handling includes useful feedback to the user

## System Architecture Update

For reliable UI-backend integration, systems now follow these patterns:
1. Server systems register with CoreRegistry for dependency management
2. Systems use EventBridge for inter-system communication
3. Client systems use ClientRegistry and ClientEventBridge
4. UI modules attach to relevant client systems
5. Data flows from server → client system → UI component

## UI Development Guidelines

The following guidelines have been established for all future UI development:
1. Use UIComponent as the base class for all UI modules
2. Follow UIStyle for consistent theming and appearance
3. Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
4. Use standardized animation patterns for consistency
5. Include proper error handling with user feedback
6. Test UI components across different device types
7. Document all public methods and properties
8. Implement accessibility features where applicable

The UI components review validates our architectural approach and confirms the successful migration of most critical interfaces. The remaining UI modules have been prioritized for May 2025 implementation, with clear guidelines for their development.

## Next Steps for UI Development

1. Complete implementation of remaining priority UI modules
2. Create centralized UI hub system for unified interface
3. Enhance UI testing framework for automated validation
4. Implement theme customization options
5. Add comprehensive accessibility features
6. Create unified notification system across all UI components
7. Build dashboard for key player metrics
8. Implement improved UI performance monitoring
